## Beyond Code

I believe what we do defines us, but *why* we do it gives it meaning. My passions play a crucial role in shaping how I think, create, and connect:

**Reading** — I'm a curious reader of philosophy and history, especially classical works and existentialist thought. I'm also a big fan of comics and graphic novels!

**Photography** — For two years, I worked as a motorsport photographer with a Canon R10. I occasionally practice astrophotography and always carry a camera when traveling or exploring!

**Science** — Physics, mathematics, and astrophysics are my lifelong intellectual companions. The mystery of how the universe works, from quarks to galaxies, fuels my sense of wonder!

**Music** — I have studied a lot of the history of music, from a purely social/historical point of view but I also play drums. This led me to meet many artists of various musical genres, starting with the blues and ending with the various genres of today. I also listen to a lot of classical music although my favorite genre remains pop-punk-rock!
